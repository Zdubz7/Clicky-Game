# Clicky-Game

- This app utilizes React.Js. React.Js is an open-source JavaScript library which is used for building user interfaces specifically for single page applications. It's used for handling view layer for web and mobile apps. React also allows us to create reusable UI components.

- To start this app you must input npm start into your terminal to be redirected to this url http://localhost:3000/ or you can access the deployed heroku link https://secure-eyrie-13880.herokuapp.com/ 

- PROJECT INFORMATION

- The application should render different images (of your choice) to the screen. Each image should listen for click events.

- The application should keep track of the user's score. The user's score should be incremented when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score should be reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once.

- Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page should shuffle themselves in a random order.

- Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game should restart.
